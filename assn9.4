#9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has the sent the greatest number of mail messages.
# The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. 
# The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced,
# the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

#Get the name of the file that the user enters
name = raw_input("Enter file:")
#if the user does not enter any filename
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)

#initialize and declare local variables

#list to store and sort the hour and its respective count
list = list()

#initialize the max count to 0
count = 0

#create a disctionary to store the count for each ID
all = dict()

#String to store the id with the max count
user = ""

#read the lines from the file and split it into words and store in the list
for line in handle:
	line = line.rstrip()
	if not line.startswith("From "): continue
	else:
		words = line.split()
        list.append(words[1])
        	
#compute the count for each id in the list into the dictionary			
for id in list:
    all[id] = all.get(id,0)+1
    if all.get(id) > count:
        count = all.get(id)
	user = id      
        
#print the user with max count		
print user , count
